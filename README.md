Make a python module that creates a graph of the temperature data generated by a 
Pigrow open-source growbox and greenhouse automation device to win great prizes! 

Pigrow is an open source project which shares it's code and designs freely, we want to make the best possible growbox automation software and are experimenting with the idea of running competitions to help gain interest and get some cool features added, if this competition works we'll be running many more ever bigger and better competitions in the future so subscribe to www.reddit.com/r/Pigrow and watch this introduction video to the pigrow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F756b0_3Afk and subscribe to the channel for future updates :) 

--- How to Enter ---

There's room for code and instructions towards the top of temp_graph.py 
  
When you've created your graph post the code and images it outputs for the three example logs included to the competition thread on www.reddit.com/r/Pigrow or alternatively email your entrance to calvineurof@yahoo.com

Competition Example Logs 

There are three logs each covering a different time-range, these are logs recorded from a DHT22 sensor and contain first the Temperature data then the Air Humidity Percentage and finally the datetime string, the three readings are sepearated by a single '>' character.  Though you don't need to worry about this, inside temp_graph.py is a function that'll read the logs and pass you two lists, one with the Temp data and the other with the Datetime data - these are both the same length and in the same order.

To see example graphs made with the logs you can use the following command line arguments;

   ./temp_graph.py log=dht22_comp1.txt out=comp1_example.png example
   ./temp_graph.py log=dht22_comp2.txt
   ./temp_graph.py log=dht22_comp3.txt temp_unit_f colour_graph=false example

for more information on the temp_graph script use

    ./temp_graph --help
